**Parking Lot**

**Office basement has a parking lot of 120 car parking space capacity out of which 20% is reserved for**

differently-abled and pregnant women since its closest to lift.
Reserving a parking space has become a tedious job and consumes a good amount of time, hence
management has decided to automate it based on first come first serve basis.

**Evaluation:** <br />
• • Database design/ Data Structure. <br />
